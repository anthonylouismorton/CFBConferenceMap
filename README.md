# CFB Conference Map

## Introduction

With the most recent realignment in college football, it's an opportune moment to revisit the history of Division I and its subsequent evolution into Division I-A, which later became known as the Football Bowl Series (FBS) conferences.

**Important Note:** This website is an ongoing project, continually evolving to offer a more comprehensive college football conference map experience. While it's currently optimized for desktop viewing, I am actively developing a mobile-friendly version.

I appreciate your patience and encourage you to check for the latest updates and improvements regularly.

## Upcoming Features

I am committed to enhancing your experience with the College Football Conference Map. Here are some upcoming features we're working on:

- **Timelapse:** Dive into interactive timelines showcasing key events in the world of college football.
