# CFB Conference Map

## Introduction

With the most recent realignment in college football, it's an opportune moment to revisit the history of Division I and its subsequent evolution into Division I-A, which later became known as the Football Bowl Series (FBS) conferences.

**Important Note:** This website is an ongoing project, continually evolving to offer a more comprehensive college football conference map experience.

I appreciate your patience and encourage you to check for the latest updates and improvements regularly.
